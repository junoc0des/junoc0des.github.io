  this took quite a long time to get figured out and I didnt just want to give you this single button thing. I wanted to tell you that I love you so much and I'm sorry it took so long for me to figure out how to actually do this, I watched a handful of youtube tutorials an countless chatGPT questions to figure out how to something on this level (below beginner level) but like I said I love you very much and thank you for clicking yes(you had no other option) I know things havent been great between us lately but I did not want a valentines day to go by without having you as my valentine. You're such an amazing and intelligent woman and I am so blessed to even know you as well as I do. You are my muse and my goodluck charm.I find so much comfort in being with you or even speaking to you. I long for the day I will be in your arms again, and be able to inhale your scent. Thank you for always being my rock and holding me down even when I don't deserve it. I hope you liked this silly little thing and once again I love you! </div>
